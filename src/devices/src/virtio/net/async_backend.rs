//! Async network backend traits for virtio-net devices.
//!
//! This module defines the traits for implementing async network backends
//! that can be used with the `AsyncNetWorker`. The design prioritizes:
//!
//! - **Zero-copy where possible**: TX path passes borrowed slices
//! - **No locking**: All methods take `&mut self`
//! - **Async-friendly**: Separated channel for RX to avoid borrow conflicts
//!
//! # Implementing a Backend
//!
//! To create a custom network backend:
//!
//! 1. Implement `AsyncNetBackendFactory` to create your backend
//! 2. Implement `AsyncNetBackend` for packet handling
//! 3. Pass the factory to libkrun via `VirtioNetBackend::CustomAsyncFactory`
//!
//! See the async backend and worker integration in this module for patterns and guidance.

    /// Optional receiver for wake notifications from background tasks.
    ///
    /// When background tasks (like host socket handlers) have data ready,
    /// they send a unit `()` on this channel to wake the worker's poll loop.

///
/// All methods are synchronous and take `&mut self`, eliminating the need
/// for interior mutability. The backend communicates packets to the guest
/// via the channel returned in `NetBackendHandle`.
///
/// # TX Path (Guest -> Backend)
///
/// `handle_guest_tx` receives a borrowed slice. The backend can:
/// - Process inline with zero copies (e.g., feed directly to a TCP/IP stack)
/// - Copy only when needed for async operations (e.g., host socket sends)
///
/// # RX Path (Backend -> Guest)
///
/// The backend sends packets via the `mpsc::Sender<Bytes>` it receives
/// during creation. The worker awaits on the corresponding receiver.

    /// Handle a packet from the guest.
    ///

    /// is borrowed - the backend must copy if it needs to retain the data
    /// beyond this call (e.g., for async host socket operations).

    /// readiness, etc.

    /// packets. The returned bytes are included in the device's snapshot and
    /// passed back to `restore_snapshot_state` on restore.

/// Factory trait for creating async network backends.
///
/// The factory pattern allows the backend to initialize async resources
/// inside the worker's tokio runtime, which is necessary for backends
/// that spawn tasks or use async I/O.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// 1. Create a factory on the main thread with configuration
/// 2. Pass the factory to the VMM via `VirtioNetBackend::CustomAsyncFactory`
/// 3. The async worker calls `create()` inside its own runtime
/// 4. Backend async resources are properly initialized on the correct runtime

    /// Create the backend and return a handle for communication.
    ///
    /// Called inside the worker's tokio runtime on a `LocalSet`, so the
    /// backend can spawn `!Send` tasks if needed.
    ///
    /// The backend should store the `mpsc::Sender<Bytes>` internally
    /// for sending packets to the guest.
